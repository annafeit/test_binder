Many design problems in HCI can be cast as assignment problems, but there are also other problem classes in combinatorial optimization which can be useful to know about when trying to abstract a design problem. See for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization#Specific_problems\">here</a>.\n",
